#### GifTastic
GifTastic offers a basic webpage to populate with gifs related to a specific keyword. You can click subject searchterms or add your own subject. A call is made to the free giphy api and returns 10 still gifs that, when clicked, become animated gifs.
In it's current state, it is themed around animation but it could easily be themed around any other subject or no subject.

##Getting Started/Prerequisites
Almost nothing has to be done to use this. Chrome is the recommended browser (some functionality *might* be missing on IE, Edge or Safari) but you can pretty much pull the repo and go. I would also recommend requesting your own giphy api if you intended on attempting your own version of this app seeing as how api keys can expire over time.

##Built With
-Bootstrap
-jQuery
-GiphyApi
-GoogleFonts
-all coding done in Visual Studio Code (although you could use whatever, of course)

##Versioning
#UPDATE:
Mobile version is now largely fixed. Might be a few hiding bugs.

Do not attempt to use any commit prior to June 25th, 2018. It was not yet a functining app. In it's current state, it is not yet optimized for mobile. The functionlity is all there but the presentation is lacking. Feel free to give it a whirl.
